;  Name: Electricity
;  Programming Language: x86-64 (Pure Assembly)

;  Status: Completed
;  References Consulted: Ed Jorgensen, "x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu"
;  Future Upgrades: Add support for alternating current (AC) and multi-loop circuits. Improve floating-point handling 
;  and input validation.
;
;Purpose
;  This program receives partial information about a DC electric circuit composed of three sub-circuits. Based on the 
;  input provided by the user, it calculates missing values such as voltage, current, or resistance using Ohmâ€™s Law 
;  and basic circuit rules. This project was designed not only to apply problem-solving to electrical engineering 
;  concepts, but also to provide the programmer with experience in developing a **pure assembly** program.
;
;Pure Assembly Philosophy
;  The program is intentionally built using **pure assembly language**, meaning it uses only the native x86-64 assembly
;  without relying on supporting languages like C or C++. This contrasts with hybrid assembly programs that interface
;  with high-level languages. The objective is to give the programmer a deeper understanding of low-level operations 
;  and direct hardware interaction by avoiding abstraction layers.
;
